# Basic concepts in Machine learning
- ML is a distinct field in Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- While a software is developed using a programing language to achieve certain objectives by hardcoded
- ML learns from the input data and its behavior to predict from future unknown input dataset.

- Machine learning algorithms are 2 types
  1. Supervised ML
  2. Unsupervised ML

## Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and other useful terms
1. Overfitting: Learning happens only for the input dataset and fails to predict for future dataset
2. Loss function: a meausre to estimate how well our model fir with out input. Typical function is Mean-Square Error
3. Epoch: Completed Iterations of training
4. Learning Rate: how much to change the model in response to the error rate estimated during the training.
5. Activation models
  + ReLU
  + Tanh
  + Sigmoid
  + Linear
