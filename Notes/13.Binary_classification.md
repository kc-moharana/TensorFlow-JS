# Binary classification
- problems in which each item is classsified into two classes:
  + emails: spam or not spam
  + transactions: fradulent or genuine
  + Sentiment analysis: positive or negative.
- regression problems vs classification problems
  + regression problems can be converted to binary problems by using a cutoff
  + house price as input can classify house categories: above 1 million dollar or below 1 million dollar.
- outcomes can be represented as 0 or 1.


## Visualizing binary class dataset.
- in house price dataset, we want to see which features make a house cost more than 1 million dollars.
  + one hypotheisis is having a waterfront like ocean, lake etc can make a house more costlier than a house of similar size and without a water body.
  + waterfront is binarydata 0/1.
- we will plot the same **Price vs House_size**, but will color the points based on the waterfront.



## Training model

```javascript
model = tf.sequential();

    model.add(tf.layers.dense({
      units: 10,
      useBias: true,
      activation: 'sigmoid',
      inputDim: 2,        //  2 values for 2 features input
    }));
```

```javascript
const optimizer = tf.train.adam();
    model.compile({
      loss: 'binaryCrossentropy',  // more granularity towards binary classification
      optimizer,    
    });
```


## Visualizing training models (Visualising classes with heat map)
- unlike linear regression models we dont see the loss per epoch.
  + `plotPredictionLine()` in no more used
- we make a heatmap per epoch.
  + both axis in an increasing order.
  + the cells/tiles have a fractional value between 0 to 1.
  + values more towards 0 has a darker color (for example) and towards 1 have lighter color.
  + this gives us an overall idea about how well the model is working.
