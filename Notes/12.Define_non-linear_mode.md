## Non-liner prediction curve

- linear models have limited capailitites affecting the prediction accuracy.
- various **non-linear activations** are available that better fit with the data.
  + `sigmoid` :

### Multiple layers
- adding more layers enables analyzing complex problems.
  + First node is input layer: so may have units:10 and inputDim:1
  + Second layer will receive output from first layer: units:10 but no inputDim.
  + Third layer is the output layer: units:1 and no inputDim.

- Epochs can be 20 or 100 or any number.
- learning rate can be challenging while using mullti-layed models.
  + use ` tf.train.adam()` will be helpful in traing the model.




## Hyperparameters.
- most advanced models are aimed at optimizing Hyperparameters
