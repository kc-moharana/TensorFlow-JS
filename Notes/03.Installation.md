# Installing TensorFlowJS
- there are two modes of installations
  1. using as javascript in the HTML page. For userfacing application it is very useful. 'script' tag van be used to import the js script from CDN.
  2. Using NPM build tools in Node.js enviornment. Useful for Backend implementation. Useful for commandline tools.

## Using Script tag in HTML page
- insert the following line in your HTML page head section.
`<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs@2.0.0/dist/tf.min.js"></script>`
- default PureJS backend uses only the CPU for calculation
- WebGL backend can used the Graphics Card or the GPU for matrix calculations. Thus making it performance wise much faster than PureJS backend.


## Using TensorFlowJS in Node.js
- use the LTS version of node.js.
- Anything that is NOT CPU intensive can be used for Node.js
  + Rest API and microservices
  + Interacting with DB like mongoDB
  + real time services
- Additionally we can create a simple http server using NodeJS
  + useful for visualizing HTML files
  + useful for reading CSV files and other data files easily.
