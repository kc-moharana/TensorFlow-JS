# Training and Testing
1. Take features and outputs.
2. Create training and test datasets.
3. Use the Trainig data to the model and evaluate the loss. Optimizer will adjust the model to minimize loss.
4. Iterate this till we arrive at minimum loss. The number of Iterations is called epoch.
5. Finally use the test data to evaluate the model. This is done one time and not iteratively.
6. Guard against overfitting.
7. we may have an additional set of data: validation.


  -  model.fit(...) or model.fitDataset(...) are used to train a model
  -  The model is trained with batches
  -  We can monitor the training process using callbacks
  -  We can visualise the training process using tfjs-vis
  -  Visualising loss for every batch trained can slow down the training process
  -  Increasing batch size increases the number of epochs required to optimise the model
  -  model.evaluate(...) or models.evaluateDataset(...) are used for testing
  -  When evaluating a single loss value is returned (plus optional metrics)


```javascript
async function trainModel(model, trainFeatureTensor, trainLabelTensor ){

  return model.fit(
  trainFeatureTensor,
  trainLabelTensor,
  {
    epochs: 20,
    callbacks: {
      onEpochEnd: (epoch, log)=>console.log(`Epoch ${epoch}: ${log.loss}`)
    }
  });

}
```


## Saving and loading the trained models
- Models created with the `tf.layers.*`, `tf.sequential()`, and `tf.model()` APIs of TensorFlow.js and later saved with the `tf.LayersModel.save()` method.
- A `model` topology and weights to browser **local storage**; then load it back.

```javascript
const model = tf.sequential(
     {layers: [tf.layers.dense({units: 1, inputShape: [3]})]});
model.summary();
const saveResults = await model.save('localstorage://my-model-1');

const loadedModel = await tf.loadLayersModel('localstorage://my-model-1');
loadedModel.summary();
```
